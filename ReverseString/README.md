Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

**Follow up:** Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1**
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints**
- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.
