Given an integer `n`, return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

**Example 1**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
- 0 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
