Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example 1**
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

**Constraints**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>5</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
