| Time Complexity | O(n + m), where `n` is length of array `a` and `m` is length of array `b` |
| Space Complexity | O(n + m), where `n` is length of array `a` and `m` is length of array `b` |

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return *their sum as a binary string*.

**Example 1**
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

**Constraints**
- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
