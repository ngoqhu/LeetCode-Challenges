Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1**
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 4**
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
