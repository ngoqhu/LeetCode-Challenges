Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a **linear runtime complexity** and use only **constant extra space**.

**Example 1**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- -3 * 10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once
