Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:

| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |

1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
