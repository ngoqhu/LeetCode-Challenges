Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., x<sup>n</sup>).

**Example 1**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```

**Constraints**
- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- -2<sup>31</sup> <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup>-1
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= x<sup>n</sup> <= 10<sup>4</sup>
