Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example 1**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 4**
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 5**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Constraints**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
