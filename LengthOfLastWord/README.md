Given a string `s` consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Example 1**
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**
- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
