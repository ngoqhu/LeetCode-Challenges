Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

**Example 1**
```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Constraints**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
