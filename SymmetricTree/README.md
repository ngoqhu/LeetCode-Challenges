Given the `root` of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1**
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
