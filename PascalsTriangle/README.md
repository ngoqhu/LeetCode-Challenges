Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

**Example 1**
```
Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: numRows = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

**Constraints**
- 1 <= numRows <= 30
